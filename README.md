This repository contains various plugins and libraries used in web development projects. Below is a list of the included plugins:

## Included Plugins

-   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations.
-   **Swiper**: A modern touch slider with hardware-accelerated transitions.

## How to Use
## Using via CDN

To include any of these libraries in your project, you can load them via a CDN. Replace `USERNAME`, `REPOSITORY`, and `FILENAME` with the appropriate values for your specific file.
